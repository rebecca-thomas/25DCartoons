This week I was working on the steps that come after finding the anchor position.
This involves calculating rays that go from the center of the stroke in the direction
of the camera. Then once I have the rays I need to find an anchor point by minimizing 
the distance from the point to the rays. This is done by calculating the project onto
each ray and averaging the points that are found. 

I still have not figured out how to get the center of the strokes. I was able to find
a C++ library that gives each stroke a center point. However, I cannot just use this
library because it does not have a way to load in svg images. So I am still skipping 
this part for now.

I am still a little bit behind schedule but have made up a fair amount of the work. 
This next week I will be working on the interpolation and z-ordering. I'm still a bit
confused about how to handle the interpolation. I will need to look over the paper 
again to try and work out how to intermix the interpolation and z-ordering.
