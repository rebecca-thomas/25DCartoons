I've created a parser to read in a simple fie that is of the format:

numKeyViews
filename0
x0
y0
z0
filename1
x1
y1
z1
....
filenameN
xN
yN
zN

Then each view is loaded and stored in an array of svg objects. 
The camera positions are also stored in an array with the same 
indexing. Then I filter through the svg object getting all the 
subelements and storing them in a dict for that view. The 
dictionaries are stored in an array that is indexed in the same
way. By storing the strokes in a dictionary I can look them up 
across views by name. This requires that the images be created 
in a way that the strokes are named consistently across the views.
